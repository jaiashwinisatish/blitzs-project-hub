Got you 👍
Here are **practical AI-friendly frontend rules** you can literally paste into a prompt or use as a **design checklist** for a **minimal, professional, modern website**.

---

## 🧠 Core Design Philosophy (Non-Negotiables)

- **Less UI, more clarity**
- Every element must **justify its existence**
- Design for **scannability**, not decoration
- White space is a **feature**, not empty space

---

## 🎨 Color Rules (Modern & Professional)

- Use **1 primary color**, **1 neutral accent**, **1 semantic color** (error/success)
- Backgrounds:
  - #FFFFFF / #F9FAFB (light)
  - #0F172A / #111827 (dark)

- Avoid pure black (#000) → use **soft blacks**
- Gradients:
  - Very subtle, 2 colors max
  - Same hue, different saturation

- No neon, no rainbow, no harsh contrasts

✅ Example palette:

- Primary: Indigo / Blue / Teal
- Neutral: Slate / Zinc / Gray
- Accent: Emerald or Amber (sparingly)

---

## 🔤 Typography Rules

- Max **2 font families**
- Prefer system or clean fonts:
  - Inter
  - SF Pro
  - Manrope
  - Plus Jakarta Sans

- Font scale:
  - H1: 40–48px
  - H2: 28–32px
  - Body: 15–16px

- Line height: **1.6–1.8**
- No center-aligned long text

---

## 📐 Layout & Spacing

- Use **8px spacing system** (8, 16, 24, 32…)
- Max content width: **1100–1200px**
- Grid-based layout (12-column or CSS grid)
- Avoid boxed layouts everywhere — mix **open sections**

Rule:

> If two elements are close, they are related.
> If not related, add space.

---

## 🧩 Components Design Rules

- Rounded corners: **6–12px**, consistent everywhere
- Shadows:
  - Soft, low opacity
  - No heavy drop shadows

- Buttons:
  - One **primary CTA per screen**
  - Secondary buttons = outline or ghost

- Forms:
  - Labels always visible
  - No placeholders as labels

---

## 🎞️ Animation & Interaction

- Animations must feel **functional**, not flashy
- Use:
  - Fade
  - Slide (small distance)
  - Scale (very subtle)

- Duration: **150–250ms**
- Easing: `ease-out` or `cubic-bezier`
- Avoid infinite animations

Rule:

> If animation draws attention to itself, it’s wrong.

---

## 🧑‍💻 UI/UX Best Practices

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Obvious CTA
- Predictable navigation
- Icons only when they add meaning
- Hover states everywhere (desktop)
- Focus states for accessibility

---

## 📱 Responsive Design Rules

- Mobile-first
- Touch targets ≥ **44px**
- No horizontal scrolling
- Avoid hiding important actions on mobile
- Typography scales, spacing compresses

---

## 🧪 AI Prompt Add-On (You can copy)

```
Follow minimal, professional, and modern UI/UX principles.
Use clean typography, generous white space, soft shadows,
subtle animations, and a neutral color palette with one
primary accent. Prioritize clarity, consistency, and
accessibility. Avoid visual clutter, excessive gradients,
and decorative elements without function.
```

---

## ❌ Avoid These (Instantly Looks Amateur)

- Too many colors
- Too many fonts
- Heavy gradients
- Over-rounded UI everywhere
- Glassmorphism everywhere
- Animations on load for no reason
